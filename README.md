# Session 1 - Getting Started and HTML
Within this branch I'll be briefly discussing the slides and going over the homework set at the end of session 1.

## The slides
##### _Basics of a website_
A website is constructed using HTML (HyperText Markup Language) which describes the structure of the page, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) which describes the presentation of the page and optionally JS (JavaScript) which allows for user interactivity (making the website more dynamic).

Each page in the website is a separate file and is defined in the URL as the final element e.g. 'examplewebsite/pages/first_page'

In brief: websites are a collection of pages (files) that linked together with various stylings applied to them to create a better user experience.

##### _Folder Structure is Important!_
Keeping the file structure simple and easy to understand is not only important because it keeps everything organised, but it also makes the website more understandable/readable for anyone charged with mandating/updating the website.

Example folders you might have in your website could include:
* css
* js
* html

#### _HTML Elements_
Each element has an opening and closing section. Some elements are structured with two tags `<tag>`_Content_`</tag>` while others just use the one `<tag attribute="value">`.
Elements can have associated attributes e.g. `<div style="color: red;"></div>`.
To make HTML easier to read we usually indent the various elements by pressing the `tab` key showing the parent/child hierarchy.




During the lesson, a few of you asked what the point of the `type="text/css"` actually does in the link tag. `.

# Homework
This exercise is an extension of the work set in Week 1. The premise of it once again asks you to modify some given content so that it looks like the solution image. The main purpose of this exercise is to show off some the various CSS selectors you can use (for a full list of CSS selectors please find the reference material [here](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp "CSS Selectors")).

Your CSS may or may not look completely different to the one I have provided





_Note_:
When looking at the example solutions, you might notice that the `html`, `head` and `body` tags are all aligned on the same line. This is due to the way my text editor auto-indents and is the general accepted way of indentation. If you'd like to read up on why this is the case Scott Granneman provides a thorough but concise explanation [here](https://www.granneman.com/webdev/coding/formatting-and-indenting-your-html/#what-about-the-basic-structure "HTML Indentation")

Both of the next two CSS selectors do exactly the same thing,
however the former is using a specific CSS selector property while the 
latter uses a classe assigned in the html.

There are multiple ways to achieve the same thing!
