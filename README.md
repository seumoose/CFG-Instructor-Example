# Session 1 - Getting Started and HTML
Within this branch I'll be briefly discussing the slides and going over the homework set at the end of session 1.

## The slides
##### _Basics of a website_
A website is constructed using HTML (HyperText Markup Language) which describes the structure of the page, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) which describes the presentation of the page and optionally JS (JavaScript) which allows for user interactivity (making the website more dynamic).

Each page in the website is a seperate file and is defined in the URL as the final element e.g. 'http://www.examplewebsite.com/pages/**first_page**'

In brief: websites are a collection of pages (files) that linked together with various stylings applied to them to create a better user experience.

##### _Folder Structure is Important!_
Keeping the file stucture simple and easy to understand is not only important because it keeps everything organised, but it also makes the website more understandable/readable for anyone charged with maintating/updating the website.

Example folders you might have in your website could include:
* css
* js
* html

#### _HTML Elements_
Each element has an opening and closing section. Some elements are structured with two tags `<tag>`_Content_`</tag>` while others just use the one `<tag attribute="value">`.
Each element can vae associated attributes e.g. `<div style="color: red;"></div>`.
To make HTML easier to read we usually indent the various elements by pressing the `tab` key showing the parent/child heirachy.

# Homework
Hopefully this exercise will have been fairly straightforward. Ultimatly you are just being asked to substitue the content provided with HTML tags.

If you're unsure what certain tags do, [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp "HTML Tags") provide some greate resources.

I had a shot at the homework myself, please see notes.html for my solution.
