# CFG-Instructor-Example
Repository intended to help with teaching the CF:G beginners course at Brunel University Spring 2018.


## What is this?
This repository is intended so show example work and how you might use various aspects of web design at the appropriate teaching level.
Below you will find links to the separate branches (all building off of each other) demonstrating what I did for that week's work.

Each branch will have a text file (README etc.) detailing my opinions of the lesson's content and my thought process (with screenshots) when completing the work.

**_Disclaimer_**  
This repository is 100% unofficial and all views/opinions do not necessarily reflect the views of any of the other course instructors or the wider CF:G organisation.
