# CFG-Instructor-Example
Repository intended to help with teaching the CF:G beginners course at Brunel University Spring 2018.

## What is this?
This repository is intended so show example work and how you might use various aspects of web design at the current teaching stage.
Below you will find links to the separate branches demonstrating what I did for that week's work.

### [Week 0 Prep](https://github.com/seumoose/CFG-Instructor-Example/tree/Week-0-Pre-Course-Preparation)

### [Week 1 HTML](https://github.com/seumoose/CFG-Instructor-Example/tree/Week-1-Getting-Started-and-HTML)

### [Week 2 CSS](https://github.com/seumoose/CFG-Instructor-Example/tree/Week-2-CSS)

### [Week 3 UX](https://github.com/seumoose/CFG-Instructor-Example/tree/Week-3-UX)

Each branch will have a text file (README) detailing the key notes from the CFG slides and my thought process when completing the work.
